You obsess over your brand's message. Your voice. Your beacons. Your narrative.

Then someone asks ChatGPT about your company…

And suddenly your bold, clear positioning gets rewritten as something vague, cautious, or just plain wrong.

> **"Our revolutionary AI platform increases productivity by 40%"**  
> becomes  
> **"The company claims their AI tool may improve productivity by up to 40%"**

That's not a typo. That's **AI distortion**.

## 🧠 Welcome to APO

**Agent Perception Optimization (APO)** is how we measure and manage your brand's representation inside large language models like GPT, Claude, and Gemini.

Because visibility is no longer enough.  
**Fidelity is the frontier.**

---

## 🚨 What's Going Wrong?

Large language models don't quote — they paraphrase. And when they do, key elements of your message get altered:

- **Hedging**  
  _"Increases revenue by 25%"_ → _"May increase revenue…"_

- **Attribution bias**  
  _"Best-in-class security"_ → _"Company claims…"_

- **Omission**  
  _"Revolutionary AI platform"_ → _"AI platform"_

- **Scope creep**  
  _"Reduces churn by 40%"_ → _"Improves retention"_

These aren't one-offs — they're patterns.

## ⚙️ How APO Works

At Narradar, we analyze how AI interprets your brand when real people ask real questions.

We measure four key signals:

- 🔄 **Semantic Drift**  
  How far AI responses stray from your source material

- 🧱 **Beacon Alignment**  
  Whether your core messages survive AI reinterpretation

- 🎭 **Persona Framing**  
  How AI presents you to different audiences (e.g., investor, journalist, developer)

- 📉 **Tone & Intent Degradation**  
  Where your nuance, claims, or confidence get lost

All of this rolls up into your **APO Score** — a single metric that tells you whether AI understands you.

## 🔄 Beyond SEO: The New Optimization Stack

| Optimization | Core Question |
|--------------|----------------|
| **SEO**      | Will they find me? |
| **AEO**      | Will I be the chosen answer? |
| **GEO**      | Will the AI use my content as training material? |
| **APO**      | Will the AI represent me accurately? |

We don't replace SEO. We build on top of it.  
Because **if AI is the new homepage**, APO is how you make sure it sounds like you.
